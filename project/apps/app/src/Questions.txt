Question 1: How did you manage to fetch the list and what tool did you use?
Ans: For now i am using the fetch,  For smaller projects or when you don't need these extra features, Fetch might be enough. or we can use axios 
Question 2: What steps would you take to future improve this?
Ans: Axios offers convenience for handling HTTP requests, especially in more complex scenarios, 
whereas Fetch is simpler and native to JavaScript. If you need advanced features like interceptors, better error handling, or request cancellation, Axios is a great choice.
